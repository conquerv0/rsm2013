# Lecture 2: Evaluating Framework

> "What problems can you solve with this technology that cannot be delivered in any other methods?"

## 1. Twin Paradox Labs

### 1. Value Propositions

1. Making quantum sensors smaller, ligher, cheaper.
2. Applications in emissions sensing, gravity measuring, atomic clocks.
3. Value creation not quantified by TPL
4. Lack of clear prioritization/direction

### 2. Market Size
1. Not defined by TPL
2. Estimated market size = $700M
(Note: Market size is crucial. If a CDL venture after session 1 cannot pitch a market larger than $billions)
*Founder rebutal:* Greengas monitoring, space navigation, mining. 

### 3. Product/Technology
1. Detailed technology roadmap
2. MVP produced but supply chain issues exist

### 4. Team
1. Tech-focused team
2. No past experience starting a company.
3. Lack of business expertise

### 5. Scalability
1. Not clearly defined by TPL
2. Hardware business not easily scalable. 


## 2. Inherit Chains

1. Management Team: strength(years of experience vs. top)
2. Product (core technology not scalable)
3. Market Size: Low potential to scale, low frequency of use; small, slow growing market.

### 1. Strength
### 2. Weakness



## 3. Xpan Inc.

### 1. Strength
1. The learning curve of the techonology is very small. 
2. Patented expansion techonolgy enables a user to expand from a 3mm diameter to a 12 mm

### 2. Weakness
1. The total acheivement market size is too small. 
2. It would be really hard to penetrate the market, as it's very difficult for surgeons to adopt this technology



## 4. Mesosil

### 1. Stregnth
1. The founders are well-compatible with a secondary market (28 billions TAM) resilient. 
2. Dental restoration is very cost-ineffective.


### 2. Weakness
1. There is a lack of capacity to scale their products. 
2. Their unfair advantage is not clearly defined. 
3. The value chain is very complex, a lot of competitors to interact with.
4. Co-founders have internal conflicts that still remains to be solved.  (Co-founder meltdown)




## 5. Formic.ai

### 1. Strength

1. Their current model outperforms the state-of-the-art
2. The technology 

### 2. Weakness

1. They do not have unique datasets that will provide them edge in the training of the model. 

My new ranking of the ventures is largely based on three criterias. 

First, market demand: is the firm's total addressable market significant? Will the utlimate end user adopts this technolgy? If the potential market for this technolgy is not sufficiently massive (>$10billions)

Second, techonolgy robustness: is the core techonolgy robust enough to sustain a long-term advantage over exisiting firms and potential entrants? Has the technolgy been validated?
