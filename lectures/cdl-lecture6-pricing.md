# Lecture 6: Pricing

## 6.1 Pricing as an Mechanism

1. A pricing structure is the mechanism by which you earn your revenue.
- example: nonlinear pricing (pay per usage, quantity bundling), exclusive tier, subscription model
- Paper reference: "Law of the Jungle"

2. Entrepreneurial pricing involves experimenting with pricing structures given uncertainty about added value of your various products.

## 6.2 Exercise: Mediachain
> Mediachain idea: produce a decentralized blockchain ledger that tracks standardized metadata in images, songs, and videos, use consensus voting on the blockchain to ensure ownership is agreed upon.

1. Who should pay?
- Owner of the copyright. 
- Agency
- Lawyer

2. How should they pay (fixed price, auction)
- We can charge the IP owner a percentage of commercialized usage.
- As we can track the usage of the IP, we can potentially charge people who want to obtain this data.
- Since we can provide IP usage, we can provide unlicensed usage of IP (IP violation) to lawyer to get a lead on their case. 

3. Why do those answers solve the problem of "I don't know how much payer X values my product"?


## 6.3 Versioning and Discrimination

1. Versioning is both easier and more valuable for digital products.

2. Basic Economics of versioning:
- If fixed costs high and variable costs low, versioning is especially useful.
- If worried about price rise/new features causing customers to say no, split into basic and premium

3. When fixed costs are high and variable costs are low or zero, there are many ways to sell.
