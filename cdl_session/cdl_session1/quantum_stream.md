## 1.1 Venture’s Proposed Objectives
    1. Transfer 1/4 of the remaining codes from Mathematica into Python, with testing and verification, to autonomize CirQubit’s software.
    2. Test Python codes on various circuit designs, more specifically on two types of qubit-qubit couplers.
    3. Scale up numerical methods to include spectator qubits in the analysis of quantum gates and circuits.

## 1.2 Proposed New Objectives -

    1. With product overlapping with IBM “Qiskit Metal”, build a table comparing specifications and features, pros and cons. Need to precisely know how much faster/easier to use, and how much more accurate. How much more is this than a Hamiltonian generator?
    2.Who will buy this product, and for how much? The issue is companies are building their own design workflows, so might not be interested. Academics don’t have that much money. Is this a better open-source project?
    3. Do market research on what experimentalists need in the design space. Lower error qubits are most important; how does it help to know the Hamiltonian better, especially since errors from stray couplings are not hard to calculate. It is possible EM simulation, error estimates from stray couplings, and algorithm error predictions are much more useful.

## Session Critique
1. Worked with IBM to publish an academic jounral in quantum simulation in circuit design. 

# 2. Qbrain

## 2.0 VENTURE DESCRIPTION: 

Qbrain is developing quantum software to solve intractable optimization problems at high speeds for companies in areas such as financial institutions and logistics companies. The use of quantum computation is limited by currently available hardware, making it difficult for companies to exploit quantum computing (QC) applications in the near term. Qbrain’s hardware agnostic solution combines quantum techniques and AI to reduce resource requirements on currently available hardware.

## 2.1 Venture’s Proposed Objectives
1.  Secure a lead investor for €2M EUR seed round.
2. Finalize the planning phase of JPMorgan’s pilot projects and start one of them.
3. Apply for European Innovation Council (EIC) Pathfinder for €2M in non-dilutive financing.

1. REPLACE - Meet with DWave and understand how what they are doing will work on their machine and who else is doing the same thing and where they are at.  They are not the only one working on optimization problems so a key part of fund raising will be able to say how what they are doing is unique or why they will win.

## 3.0 VENTURE DESCRIPTION: 

WeLinQ is developing a full-stack memory system to link quantum processors for quantum computing (QC) companies. QCs require interconnects to scale up as many architectures are hitting fundamental limits on how many qubits they can have without adding tremendous cost, noise, and engineering challenges. This quantum memory uses a cold atom cloud to store and synchronize photonic qubits emitted by the processors, where the software is used to distribute the computing resources accordingly. The product can improve storage efficiency and memory times by orders of magnitude allowing them to scale up their processing units above the thousands of qubits regime and enabling them to solve larger-scaled industry-relevant problems that are not possible with conventional supercomputers such as the exact simulation of penicillin.

## 3.1 Venture’s Proposed Objectives

1. Close WeLinQ's pre-seed round.
2. Recruit three more engineers for hardware development and integration.
3. Finalize the development plan for the source (technical, funding) to be in a position to autonomously develop the core memory product and specify interfaces for future collaborations
