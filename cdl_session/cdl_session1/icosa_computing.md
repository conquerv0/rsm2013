## 1. Icosa Computing

### 1.0 Venture Description: 
Icosa Computing builds quantum computing based software to solve discrete optimization problems that data-driven institutions, such as finance companies, are faced with. Financial institutions need to process large discrete datasets but are limited to narrow optimization pipelines, making optimization problems difficult to solve. Icosa expands those pipelines with quantum-based methods and special-purpose hardware, enabling them to solve problems that are 100x larger than those solvable by conventional methods. Icosa’s proprietary hyperparameter tuning allows a large time scale of historical data to be considered more accurately, enabling finance companies to beat financial benchmarks and generate higher returns.

Objective: Use quantum computing to enable large scale time horizon to better improve portfolio returns. 

### 1.1 Objective Critique

1. The core business is to outsource the capacity to construct optimized portfolio. 
2. Market seems unclear since hedge fund are already charge a very high premium for portfolio optimization services, the added service is basically adding another markup. 

### 1.2 Venture’s Proposed Objectives
1. Beat customer benchmarks with current hedge fund client.
2. Have increased commitments for the $1.36M CAD seed round which includes robust terms & safe caps agreed upon.
3. Hire 4 technical roles and 1 business role, and define the cap table for early employees.

### 1.3 Proposed New Objectives - 
@Paul.Lee.Fellow
- Objective Setter
1. State clearly the hypothesis of how they can beat the market using historical data and then show hypothesis works using historical data
2. Beat customer benchmarks over the next period with the current fund client to show that it works going forward and not just through historical data
3. Close seed round.

### 1.5 Investor Comments
1. @Samuel.Mugel.Associate
    Really impressed by customer engagement (including signing hedge fund, which is difficult). You will be in a good position if you can prove your technology works with your hedge fund but will be hard to do.

3. @Christophe.Jurczak.Associate’s question.
    @Mert.Esencan.Icosa Computing.Venture
    (response to Christophe’s question). We don’t have enough capital to bootstrap. We want to focus on building product.
    @Charles.Lespérance.Associate
    Not convinced by founder’s response. Don’t believe you should be outsourcing their core business.

    @Eric.Hixon.Associate
    Unclear how big market is and how you will sell yours at a premium compared to others. You need to demonstrate why you are better.

    @Paul.Lee.Fellow
    I funded a company who had to make this choice too: build a product or build company as a hedge fund. We chose to have them build a product and their return was much higher than it would be if they had become a hedge fund.

# CDL Session 2

### 2.1 PROGRESS ON SESSION ONE OBJECTIVES:
>1. State clearly the hypothesis of how they can beat the market using historical data and then show hypothesis works using historical data. (Complete)
>2. Beat customer benchmarks over the next period with the current fund client to show that it works going forward and not just through historical data. (Complete)
>3. Close seed round. (Incomplete) - Will apply two U.S. SBIR government grants for $500K USD total.

### 2.2 Venture PROPOSED 2-MONTH OBJECTIVES:
>1. Finish AWS integration focusing on the ML hyperparameter tuning with best practices around distributed computing.
>2. Put the beta version of a fully-automated optimization product in the cloud.
>3. Acquire original R&D results with the current hardware partnership, demonstrating solving the largest discrete optimization problems ever tackled.

### 2.3 Proposed New Objectives
1. Finish AWS integration focusing on the ML hyperparameter tuning with best practices around distributed computing.
2. Create a beta version of a fully automated optimization product in the cloud customers can put into production.
3. Demonstrate R&D results with hardware partner that optimize with over 100K assets or stocks

### 2.4 Critiquer: Objectives Change Rationale

1. AGREE
2. AGREE
3. MODIFY: Sign 3 new pilot projects to keep rolling out this product and accelerate live testing

> Changed the last objective since they are at a stage where it make sense to 

### 2.5 LRD Discussion
@John.Francis.Fellow
: They've had good results on historical data, and now on real client live market data. Very exciting tech. Proven with a customer. Amazing lead. I love this part. They have a 50/50 share of returns with their hedge fund lead client.

@Charles.Lespérance.Associate
: Right now they are doing great with the hedgefund's benchmark. 36% vs 12%. Great result. It's the right time to reach out and leverage this to onboard more clients.

@John.Martinis.Fellow
: I'm quite interested in this company, actually one of my co-founders at colab is working with them as a mentor. Their work is exciting. Their timeline is looking great. I like that they use special hardware optimizers, many of which are developed in Japan. I think it's a good balance of various technologies.
I'm not a firm believer on doing the R&D results vs signing new pilots.

@Samuel.Mugel.Associate
: It sounds like they have a good product that blows benchmarks out of the water. Some resources should go into improving tech, but now that you've proven it I would go into trying to monetize it with more clients.
We found banks to be more approachable than hedgefunds. A lower hanging fruit might be to chase a bank or large company like BMW. Ones that have their own internal banks that experiment with trading. Publishing papers with customers gives 2 things:
Marketing by announcing what you've done with them
If in a peer reviewed journal it can pre-emptively dismantle skepticism of results.

@John.Martinis.Fellow
: They're doing well in the Turkish market which doesn't have all the hedge fund people there trying to optimize the market, so it may be slightly easier. But in the US market they beat S&P Index but it doesn't necessarily mean they beat hedge funds in that market. I think they need to generate more metrics. For instance a virtual return on the US market in comparison to hedge funds.

@Jeff.Larsen.CDL
1.  Would diversifying client type create benefits for raising?
@Samuel.Mugel.Associate
- Benefits: 1. Easy to sign them. 2. Shows bigger TAM for investors. 3. Data. You want more data about how your product performs, thus more benchmarks and credibility.

### 2.6 Deliberation

@John.Martinis
1. They have made a lot of progress. Just need to generate more data on different experiments. Would love to continue on with the journey. 
2. Also a big plus that they are a part hardware company. 

@Neil.Wainwright @John.Francis
1. They acheived quite a lot of results under a month. 
2. They have a lot of potential to move into other routes of applications.
