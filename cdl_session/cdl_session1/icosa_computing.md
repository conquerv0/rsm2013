## 1. Icosa Computing

Objective: Use quantum computing to enable large scale time horizon to better improve portfolio returns. 

# 1.1 Objective Critique

1. The core business is to outsource the capacity to construct optimized portfolio. 
2. Market seems unclear since hedge fund are already charge a very high premium for portfolio optimization services, the added service is basically adding another markup. 

### 1.1 Venture’s Proposed Objectives
1. Beat customer benchmarks with current hedge fund client.
2. Have increased commitments for the $1.36M CAD seed round which includes robust terms & safe caps agreed upon.
3. Hire 4 technical roles and 1 business role, and define the cap table for early employees.

### 1.2 Proposed New Objectives - 
@Paul.Lee.Fellow
- Objective Setter
1. State clearly the hypothesis of how they can beat the market using historical data and then show hypothesis works using historical data
2. Beat customer benchmarks over the next period with the current fund client to show that it works going forward and not just through historical data
3. Close seed round.

1. @Samuel.Mugel.Associate
    Really impressed by customer engagement (including signing hedge fund, which is difficult). You will be in a good position if you can prove your technology works with your hedge fund but will be hard to do.

3. @Christophe.Jurczak.Associate’s question.
    @Mert.Esencan.Icosa Computing.Venture
    (response to Christophe’s question). We don’t have enough capital to bootstrap. We want to focus on building product.
    @Charles.Lespérance.Associate
    Not convinced by founder’s response. Don’t believe you should be outsourcing their core business.

    Unclear how big market is and how you will sell yours at a premium compared to others. You need to demonstrate why you are better.

    I funded a company who had to make this choice too: build a product or build company as a hedge fund. We chose to have them build a product and their return was much higher than it would be if they had become a hedge fund.
